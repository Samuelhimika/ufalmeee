         <p>Many developing countries, rich in natural resources, have welcomed private investment in their oil, gas, and mining industries. Although projects in the extractive industries can have a serious environmental impact and be socially disruptive as well—particularly if people must be resettled to make way for them—they can make a significant contribution to the economic development of host countries if their adverse consequences are minimized through careful planning. Because they generate sizable revenues, create jobs and business opportunities, and often bring new roads and access to water and power to the isolated rural areas in which they are typically located, they have the potential to stimulate economic growth, reduce poverty, and raise living standards. In addition, host countries benefit from being exposed to best international practices in project planning and
    
        implementation and forced to build up their administrative and institutional capacity.</p>
         
 <p>

             Frequently, however, national governments reap the most benefit from these projects, while social and environmental costs tend to be borne by local communities. A recent World Bank study of two oil and gas projects and two mining projects in Colombia, Papua New Guinea, and Venezuela (see box) reveals that the communities affected by these projects believe that the environmental and social costs have been heavy, while expected benefits have either failed to materialize or not been distributed in an equitable manner. These findings are particularly striking because these three countries have laws requiring that a percentage of revenues from natural-resource-based projects be allocated to regional and local development initiatives. The project developers not only carriedout extensive social and environmental studies in an effort to mitigate negative impacts 
             and maximize benefits but also provided large amounts of funding for social programs.</p>

<p>The role of government is to provide an appropriate policy framework; clearly delineate the division of responsibilities between the public and private sectors; determine how project revenues are to be used; monitor and evaluate projects; deliver education, health care, and other social services; provide security for projects; and develop mechanisms for financing rural infrastructure and planning upstream projects. Project developers must give attention to social concerns, acknowledge all stakeholders, identify risks and opportunities, assess impacts, provide for public involvement in project design and implementation, and develop mechanisms for resolving conflicts and evaluating project effectiveness. NGOs can provide valuable input and should work side by side with government officials and project developers while remaining accountable to the communities they represent. Given the growing worldwide trend toward localization, as communities demand more of a voice in their own governance, and a history of perceived broken promises and resentment toward government, community participation is critical. It should not be limited to those in a project's immediate vicinity or to a small special-interest group but should be as broad as possible. For example, because of Colombian law, revenues from the BPXC project in Colombia flow only to the 3 oil-producing municipalities in Casanare Department, although the other 16 municipalities say they are experiencing increased 
    immigration and violence as a result of the project.</p>
